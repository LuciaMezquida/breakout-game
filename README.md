# Breakout Game
The classic arcade game "Breakout" by Atari, made by Annia Kubow's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KWEud12Pxo&t=3s) in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and Sass.

## Content

In Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen and the goal is to destroy them all. A ball moves straight around the screen, bouncing off the top and two sides of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces back and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen; to prevent this from happening, the player has a horizontally movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play.
The more score you get, the faster the ball will move.

For touch devices, buttons appear to move the bar sideways. These buttons disappear on large screen devices, being able to use the keyboard for this (for phone devices, is still on project)
